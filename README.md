# FishEatFish-new
A redone version of an old assignment

In this project, I will be creating a very simple game engine in C++ using DirectX framework. I will create it from scratch, that means I will be implementing the following:

1. Rendering functions for sprites, UI, etc.
2. Input handling
3. Collision detection
4. Game logic
